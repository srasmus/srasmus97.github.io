In 2017, famed "flat Earther" and conspiracy theorist Jeran Campanella decided to prove once and for all that his worldview was true. He wanted data that proves that the Earth is not spherical like the liars at NASA claim it is, but is instead a flat disk. To prove this, he needed an experiment, and a hypothesis. He figured that if light travels in a straight line, then it should move in parallel with the surface of the flat Earth, but a round Earth would have the line moving tangently to the surface. He devised an experiment that put three posts of equal height equally spaced over a distance of four miles. He would then shine a laser pointer across the top of the first post, and if the light could be seen at the third post, it would prove that the middle post was not raised by the curvature of the Earth, and thus, the Earth was flat. This first experiment didn't really work. The laser dissapated over such a long distance that it couldn't be definitively read on the other end. So it was back to the drawing board. The second experiment used flat boards of styrofoam with holes cut into them instead of posts, and a flashlight instead of a laser pointer. The idea here was that if Jeran shined his light through the first hole, it should have been seen by the camera on the other end of the second hole. However, on the day of this experiment, much to his surprise, the light was not visible on the camera. He had to raise the light far above his head to get the light to shine through both of the holes at the same time. The only explanation was that he was on a "lower" area of ground than the boards were. Or, obviously, down below the horizon.[^1]

So, what did Jeran do with this information? Did he change his tune? Renounce his flat Earth worldview. Unfortunately not.
