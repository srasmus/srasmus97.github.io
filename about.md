Hey, I'm Sam Rasmussen. I was born in 1997 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I grew up in Bayview, a small neighborhood just south of town. I spent most of my days drawing, reading, and playing my hand-me-down Super Nintendo. I've always had a fascination with technology, nature, and anything creepy or strange. Once I got to college, I majored in Computer Science and got my bachelor's of science in 2019. Since then, I've moved to Greenfield, only about 15 minutes from my childhood neighborhood.

I made this site as a way to document some of my ideas and projects in a permanent space. In an act of mild vanity, I suppose. I probably won't post here all that often, but I'll make sure I don't abandon the project all together. If you have any questions, inquiries, or just want to chat, feel free to reach me at my email, or any of my other various accounts.

Thanks for stopping by,
